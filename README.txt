This program can be used to test the efficiency of various sorting algorithms on various sets of data.  
main.c can be compiled to generate an executable file, which can be run with a text file as an argument.  
The text file should contain a set of floating point numbers that are to be sorted.  
When the program is run, a menu will be printed to the terminal, asking the user for input.  
The user can choose to run a variety of sorting algorithms on the input data and view the amount of time it took to complete the computation.  
The user can continue to run various sorting algorithms as many times as they wish until they choose to end the program.  
The user can also print the sorted data to verify that the sorting was done correctly.
